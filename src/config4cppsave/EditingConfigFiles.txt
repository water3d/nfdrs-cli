How to add switches and settings to cfg files.

1) Edit the base cfg file from source control with new settings; e.g. NFDRSInitSample.cfg

	- Create the deaults for deadFuelMoisture
	- Create each deadFuelMoisture type (1hr, 10hr, 100hr, 1000hr), setting necessary parameters
		- only add options that need be different from defaults ( defaults can always be overridden, left out here for brevity)

2) Run the config2cpp which creates new .cpp and .h files for the config:
	e.g. config2cpp -cfg NFDRSInitSample.txt -class NFDRSInitConfig -singleton

3) Copy the newly generated .cpp and .h file to the RunNFDRS directory

4)Make code changes to read in data associated "Configuration.cpp" file, where the schema is used
	e.g. for the above, class NFDRSInitConfig is used by NFDRSConfiguration class, edit that class. CNFDRSParams will also have to be edited
